# Report 1: Learnings and Experiences in Makerspace - Week of 08/29/2023 #

---

### Exploring and Learning
This week, I primarily delved into operating the **lasercutter** in the makerspace, while also acquainting myself with the various tools available there. As a result, walking into the makerspace no longer leaves me feeling lost or out of place. My prior experience with Rhino and Grasshopper during my undergrad studies made the software aspect of this week's project not much difficulty.

### Assignment Collaboration 
In this assignment, I worked together with a girl from the MDes program, whose name is Stephanie. We first opened the 'make flat 3dm file' for the phone stand provided in class using **Rhino**, and then imported it into **Adobe Illustrator**.

### Working on Lasercutting the Phone Stand
Because the plywood sold in the makerspace is **30”x18”**, there is enough space to print phone stands for four people. So, Stephanie and I, along with two other MDes students, adjusted the file together in Illustrator. We created a board the same size as the plywood and copied five sets of the phone stand design inside it. One set is for backup, in case some students' lasercut fails.

The plywood board we used was 1/4" thick. However, a fellow student warned us that he had issues with cutting all the way through just yesterday. To mitigate this, we adjusted the lasercutter settings to treat the material as if it were 0.255" thick, aiming to ensure a complete cut. Despite this precaution, we encountered some issues because the plywood board was not perfectly flat; it was somewhat curved. As a result, a few cuts didn't go all the way through.

This is mine part, which is successful cutted.

### Personal Reflection
During my undergraduate studies, I completed many projects using a lasercutter. However, the system at RISD required student monitors to operate the lasercutter, as students weren't allowed to run the machine themselves. We had to submit our files to these trained monitors, who would then perform the cuts. On the other hand, I also had some experience at Brown University's design lab, where I received the necessary training to operate the lasercutter independently. So, familiarizing myself with the Makerspace's lasercutter wasn't too challenging for me. Nonetheless, an invaluable lesson I learned from this latest project is the **importance of running a test piece** before proceeding with the final cut. Lastly, one thing that made me happiest about this week's assignment is the good atmosphere among the **MDes students**. Although we may struggle when encountering things we don't know how to do, the mutual help among classmates makes me feel very warm.

### Speculation
I believe laser cutting technology has a lot of room for future development, including 3D multi-axis CNC laser cutting technology and automated, unmanned laser cutting technology. 3D laser cutting technology helps to steer the field towards more precise applications. Furthermore, 3D laser cutting technology is more efficient and has a broader range of applications. Moreover, as a form of processing technology, automation and unmanned operation in laser cutting technology are necessary for its development. At the same time, the application of computer network technology makes automation and unmanned operation in laser cutting technology possible. The current market demand for this technology is also continuously increasing, driving laser cutting technology to gradually realize automation and unmanned operation.
